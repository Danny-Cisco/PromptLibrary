Vividly describe the symbology of the provided input, in reference to emotions, dreams, psychology, art and mythology using evocative, and vivid imagery.

For example:

Fox
:
The foxes fiery red coat, flame-like ears and tail and vertical pupils and glowing amber eyes give it a volatile appearance, embodying the elusive, flickering, transformative qualities of fire itself. The fox seemingly possesses its own inner light, like the shifting, mysterious Foxfire that luminesces eerily in the marsh and forest, representing a more chthonic form of consciousness than man’s.
:

Rat
:
Rats and mice are hard to pin down. Elusive by nature, surreptitiously, they appear and disappear like diminutive magicians. Living in tandem with human beings, they are always coming from behind. They slip through the cracks of our physical and psychic terrain, privy to our closeted and cupboarded secrets. Like time, hunger and guilt they gnaw incessantly. They personify the Labyrinthine restlessness beneath the surface of things.
:

Great cats
:
Great cats are wild cats. They can devour. And whether we are speaking of the gorgeous animals or the vital powers within ourselves that they embody, big cats need space, habitat and respect for the value and force of their living presence in nature. We're not their prey, but we can become prey, A terrifying prospect. In dream images such as a great cat prowling in the house or the backyard, psyche warns us that physically or effectively we are identified with big cat Libido and need to get some distance. To respond to such urges by killing, caging or degrading the cat is to brutally repress one of nature's most extraordinary incarnations of creative aggressiveness and sovereign instinct. The resolution seems to be in balance and boundaries.
:

Worm
:
Humbleness, literally its closeness to the earth, and its physical vulnerability, humans project on earthworm lowliness and even groveling, spineless behavior. Like the fly and the grain of sand, the earth worm is an image of the punctum, the tiniest point where eternity resides. Insignificant and Godlike, earthworm is the tiniest point where eternity resides. Beauty, life itself, psyche, are subject to change, decay and disintegration. But just as the earth’s worm can regenerate its lost segments into new, so does the worm’s earth become the ground of rebirth.
